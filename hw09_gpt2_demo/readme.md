    They smack of honour both. Go get him surgeons.
    Exit Sergeant, attended
    Who comes here?

     What news, Lord Bardolph? every minute now
     Should be the father of some stratagem:

     And bears down all before him.

     O, who can hold a fire in his hand
     By thinking on the frosty Caucasus?
     Or cloy the hungry edge of appetite
     By bare imagination of a feast?
     Or wallow naked in December snow
     By thinking on fantastic summer's heat?

     And see his shipwreck and his commonweal's.
     Holloa! what storm is this?
